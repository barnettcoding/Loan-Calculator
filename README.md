# Loan Calculator
 A simple interest loan calculator
Takes in input - Loan amount, start date, pay frequency, interest rate, and payment amount
Shows each payment amount and date adjusting for weekends and holidays.

Code is hosted [here](https://barnettcoding.github.io/Loan-Calculator/)

Changes I would make/What I would do next:
- Most people probably don't need to see each payment. I would show just the first 10 payments with breadcrumbs to click and see the rest on another page.
- In my initial research, I found some really cool sliders and fancier selectors for input that could be used.
- To optimize this calculator, I would make it so that with incomplete information, it would fill in that information depending on what it has. For example, the user could fill it out without knowing the payment amount, but instead fill in the length of the loan. The program would work out how much the installment amount should be.
